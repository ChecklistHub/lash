<h1>The Trumpeter</h1>
<p>
<pre>
	<b>Yeahhh</b>, yet again I confess<br>my innermost flourishing with diverse feelings.
	<hr>
	Being the epitome of the family, more than more is expected of me.<br> The churning feelimg of anxiety gushing in my atomic structure that consitutes my sole existence.I wander in thought asking myself if i will be able to make the cut and prove my worthiness
	<hr>
	   Or is it that i am living in euphobia because of the explicit emotions that course their way ttoevry tendon of my very being.Tending to the sweet'horses' as i call them is becoming impulsively impossible beause of the myriad web of thoughts.
	<hr>
	Maybe it was never meant to be<br>
	   for you lost it.
